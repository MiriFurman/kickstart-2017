## Exercises
  * Add tests to the “World Clocks Wall” App you created
  * Test the clock displays the correct time
  * Test the clock displays the correct label
  * Test you can remove the Clock
  * Test you can edit the Clock’s label and it changes later in the DOM
  * Test you can add a new Clock and it shows on the Wall
  * Add a new **feature** that lets you re-order the Clocks list:
    * When clicking "Edit" two buttons will be added to the Clock box. One button named "Prev" and the second "Next".
    * Clicking the "Prev" button, will move the clock one position back in the list.
    * Clicking the "Next" button, will move the clock one position forward in the list.
    * Write a test for using the "Prev" button
    * Write a test for using the "Next" button
