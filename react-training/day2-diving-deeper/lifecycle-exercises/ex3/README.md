### Task Overview
  * Write an App that has a Toggle “Show/Hide Box” button.

  * When the button is initially clicked, a Box ("Settings Panel") will be shown somewhere on the screen.

  * After being shown for 5 seconds, another Box should appear outside the first box (AKA "Settings Panel") with a Notification - “Component already mounted for 5 seconds.”

  * When clicking the Toggle button a second time:

      a. If it is **before** the Notification was displayed, it should hide the box and not show any Notification. (make sure there are no errors in the console).

      b. If it is **after** the message is displayed, it should hide the boxes.


> **Important Notes**
  You must use the comps given to you: **Notification** & **SettingsPanel**!

>You are not allowed to merge them or erase them.
But you can/should make changes to the components as necessary to finish the task.
