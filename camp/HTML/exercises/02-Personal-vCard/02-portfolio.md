  - Each image should be a thumbnail (small size)
    - e.g. <http://lorempixel.com/200/200/sports/1/>
  - When clicked, should lead to the original sized image
    - e.g. <http://lorempixel.com/800/800/sports/1/>
  - Should have a caption (the thing on hover, just the HTML of it)
  - Show some text if the image URL is broken (also important for Accessibility) 
  - **Bonus:** What is the most appropriate HTML to describe an image with a caption?
  - **Bonus:** On image hover, show a small tooltip with the caption (HTML only)
