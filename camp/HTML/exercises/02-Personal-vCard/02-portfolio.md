Mission
---------

Add a `portfolio.html` file next to `index.html`.  
Based on the same [template](http://ashmawi.work/wp/riche/), under "Portfolio".

Requirements
-------------

- Build the HTML of the page
- Copy the navigation menu to this page as well
  - Clicking Welcome should go to `index.html` and Portfolio to `portfolio.html`
- Use 10 images from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/) or [placekitten](https://placekitten.com/)
  - Each image should be a thumbnail (small size)
  - When clicked, should lead to the original sized image
  - Should have a title (the thing on hover, just the HTML of it)
  - Show some text if the image URL is broken (also important for Accessibility) 
  - **Bonus:** What is the most appropriate HTML to describe an image with a caption?
