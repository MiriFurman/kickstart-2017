HTML5 Semantics
================

Grouping Elements
------------------

### `<main>`

> Represents the main content of the body of a document or application

- Can have only one `<main>` in a document
- Should not be placed within an `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` or `<nav>` elements

### `<header>`

> Represents the introductory content to an article or a web page

#### Usage

- A heading of a blog post, including some meta data
- A table of contents, before a long article, within a `nav` tag
- The head section of a web page (Logo, Navigation, Search Box, etc.)

### `<footer>`

> Represents information about a section

#### Usage

- Author details
- Copyright information
- Links to related web pages

Sectioning Elements
--------------------

### `<nav>`

> Used to mark up a collection of links to external pages or sections within the current page

#### Usage

- Main website navigation
- Table of Contents
- Blogroll

### `<article>`

> Represents a self-contained content that could be distributed outside the context of the page

- Can have nested articles, like a blog post and each comment on itâ€™s own

#### Usage

- Forum post
- Newspaper article
- Blog entry
- User-submitted comment
- Interactive widget or gadget
- Any other independent item of content

### `<section>`

> Represents a group of related content

- Similar to `<article>`, but doesn't necessarily need to make sense out of the context of the page
- Should have a heading in it, to define the topic of the section
- Should not be used just for styling
- Can have nested sections

#### Usage

- Chapters of an article or post
- Tabbed pages

### `<aside>`

> Represents content that is tangibly related to the content surrounding it, but could be considered separate

#### Usage

- Sidebars
- Extra info in an article or post
- Anything that is related but not so important
