Personal vCard v2
=================

Continuing the previous [exercise](../exercises/02-Personal-vCard/README.md)

Mission
---------

Add a `portfolio.html` file next the `index.html` file we worked on previously ([here](../exercises/02-Personal-vCard)).  
Based on the same [template](http://ashmawi.work/wp/riche/), under "Portfolio"

Requirements
-------------

- Build the HTML of the page (ignore the design, and assume we don't need the sidebar)
- Use 10 images from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/) or [placekitten](https://placekitten.com/)
  - Each image should link to itself when clicked and should have a title
  - **Bonus:** What is the best HTML to describe an image with a caption?
