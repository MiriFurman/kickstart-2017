<!--
  Bonus:

  Write a page that includes three fields (and a button):
    * First player age (input type=number)
    * Second player age (input type=number)
    * game (input type=text)
    * button that validates and logs a message if it did not pass validation

    Validate that the games are one of this set (and log if it isn't):
    "Game Of Thrones"
    "Monopoly"
    "Cards Against Humanity"
    "Barbie"

    Use the function canPlay from the previous exercise to log if the players can't play the game.
