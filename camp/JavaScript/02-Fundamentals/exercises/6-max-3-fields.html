<!--
  Write a page that includes 3 numeric fields (<input type=numeric>),
  and computes the maximum of the three fields: when a button is pressed it inserts
  the maximum into a div
  Use a function `max3` that computes the max of the 3 values. Don't forget to test it...

  Remember:
  * use document.getElementById('...').value; to get the string value. Don't forget to parseInt it.
  * use document.getElementById('...').innerHTML = ...; to set the text of a div
