Mission

Bonus!!!

Write a page that asks the user (using a form) for a number,
and shows that number of recent photos from Flickr, using the Flickr API.

You need to learn the Flickr API by yourself, specifically using:

- [Getting an API key](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/)
- [How a Flickr URL for an image looks like](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html)
- [How to fetch JSON data from Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/request.rest.html)
- [The API to fetch recent pictures](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getRecent.html)

To fetch a JSON from a URL, use the function `fetchSimple`, that is found in the exercise file.
You can see sample usage of this function below.

You can find a template of the page in the exercise file.
