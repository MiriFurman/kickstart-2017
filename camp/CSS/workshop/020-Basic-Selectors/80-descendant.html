<!--
  Targets every element that follows an identified ancestor
  Even if the element is not a direct child of that ancestor

  Tip:
    If your selector looks like div ul li a span.error , then you’re doing it wrong.
    Always ask yourself if it’s absolutely necessary to apply all of that weight.
