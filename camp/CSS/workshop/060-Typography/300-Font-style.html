<!--
  In the purest (type designer) sense, an oblique is a roman font that has been skewed
  a certain number of degrees (8-12 degrees, usually).
  An italic is created by the type designer with specific characters (notably lowercase a)
  drawn differently to create a more calligraphic, as well as slanted version.
