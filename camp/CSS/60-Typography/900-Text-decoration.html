<h1 class="under">Underlined Header</h1>
<p class="line">If you want to strike out text, use line-through.</p>
<h1 class="over">and now an overlined header.</h1>
<p>This <a class="none" href="#">link will not be underlined</a>, as most links are by default. Be careful with removing the text decoration on links since most users depend on the underline to signify a hyperlink.</p>
<p class="underover">This text has both underline and overline.</p>
